* What's Ruby

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and
easy object-oriented programming.  It has many features to
process text files and to do system management tasks (as in
Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

Please see README.orig for more details on the language itself.

* What's MRB

MRB is a project to enable two things: Running different versions
of the Ruby language on the same VM (derived from Ruby 1.9's VM),
and eventually to support running multiple self-contained objectspaces
within the same instance (MVM) that may be running different
languages or language versions.

Currently the main work is on making it act like Ruby 1.8.7. Eventually,
the parts that had to change for this to work will be isolated and
it will be possible to switch versions.

So far it passes most of the common-case rubyspec language specs for Ruby 1.8.7.

* Getting MRB

Currently MRB is available only from its source repository on github. You
can clone the repository as follows:

 $ git clone git://github.com/stormbrew/mrb.git

* Helping

If you'd like to help this project, clone the repository and use mspec to
find areas where expected behaviour is failing. Fix a spec and submit a pull request.
Note that we're currently looking only at the language specs in rubyspec.

To run the spec suite to find errors, run:

 $ mspec --format spec -g fails :language

Please also verify that your changes do not cause any regressions by running:

 $ mspec ci :language

If you find 1.8.7 behaviours that are not covered in rubyspec, please
write a spec for rubyspec and submit it as a pull request to them. We
will continue updating our merged copy of rubyspec to find new failures.

You can find rubyspec at: https://github.com/rubyspec/rubyspec
